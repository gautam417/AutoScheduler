# AutoScheduler Assitant

Call (866)-399-2690 to try it out!


AutoScheduler Assitant is an intelligent phone assistant that makes scheduling medical appointments seamlessly. 

Flask, Twilio's Voice API, and the OpenAI GPT-4 model are powering the application. AutoScheduler Assitant can understand user speech input and respond with the end goal of helping the user schedule their medical appointment by providing appropriate responses.

The application is available at (866)-399-2690. 

### Core Functionality
AutoScheduler Assitant is capable of handling incoming phone calls, understanding the user's speech input, and swiftly provides appropriate appointments based on the user's input. 

The application does not store any personal user data that is collected. Furthermore, the data is not shared with any third parties.

### Key Features

- Handling speech recognition and text-to-speech using the Twilio API.

### Future Plans
In future iterations of AutoScheduler Assitant, I plan to add the following features:
- Automatic SMS reminder when the call is over for the appointment if one was scheduled.
